# Project Lamas
## Overview
This repository contains geojson files provided by our client, Lamas. Due to issues with the original files, we've transferred them to a new format and organized them accordingly.

## Folder Structure
### old_geojson_files
Contains the original geojson files received from the client. These files are outdated and may be broken.

### output_files
This folder houses the new and improved geojson files. We've converted and updated them from the old_geojson_files directory for better usability and reliability.

### topo_jsons
Here reside the topojson files. These are derived from the updated geojson files in the output_files folder. Topojsons offer a more compressed and simplified format, enhancing project efficiency and ease of use.

### merged
The merged folder is designated for uploading or inserting merged JSON files. These merged files consolidate multiple layers into a single JSON for streamlined data management.
